## 👨‍💻 About me

> I am a software engineer, focusing mostly on front-end, in a love-love relashionship with Javascript. I worked professionally on all Big Three Frameworks (But secretly I love React the most). 
> I consider myself a senior frontend engineer, a medium backend developer and a junior when it comes to infrastructure and devops, but i am continously learning and trying to reach a full-stack mastery in all the above areas + a little UX and Mobile apps in between. 
> I am forever trying to strike a balance with my desire of shipping incredible UI and bring fast and great value from a Product prespective but also try to ship the cleanest, best written code I can manage.
