#### First Steps

> My passion for programming started very young, in the old days of mIRC when I was creating bots and bouncers at the young age of 12. From here I started learning everything about UNIX and even created a couple of website using FrontPage from Microsoft. I kept this hobby all throughout college but it wasn't untill I met my second passion of solving algorithms and programming challanges that I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I started with Google Code Jam - staying up at night to compete with the best and the brightest of Silicon Valey for a change to win a T-Shirt - fun times, and from there it escaleted in finding out how the WEB works and learning anything I could find to build my own websites.
