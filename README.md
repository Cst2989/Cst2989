## 👨‍💻 About me

> I am a software engineer, focusing mostly on front-end, in a love-love relationship with Javascript. I worked professionally on all Big Three Frameworks (But secretly I love React the most). 
> <br/> <br/> I consider myself a senior Frontend Engineer, a middle Backend Developer and a junior when it comes to Infrastructure and Devops, but I am continuously learning and trying to reach a full-stack mastery in all the above areas + a little UX and Mobile apps in between. 
> <br/> <br/> I am forever trying to strike a balance with my desire of shipping incredible UI and bring fast and great value from a Product perspective but also try to merge the cleanest, easily maintainable code I can possible write.
